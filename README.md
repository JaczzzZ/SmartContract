# SmartContract
### Abstract
 Hong Kong is one of the most vibrant financial centers in the world, and it aims to become a hub for virtual assets. Blockchain industry has been promoted and developed actively in Hong Kong. In the blockchain field, smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. Understanding smart contracts effectively can boost the efficiency of blockchain process. However, there is no existing mature tool for understanding smart contracts, leading to a strong demand for a tool that simplifies and clarifies smart contract comprehension. With the emergence of ChatGPT, we can use its power to make the explanation of smart contracts more easily and effectively. Our system is named ContractGPT, a smart contract explainer built on the GPT-3.5 API. And it achieves the effective reading, understanding and explanation of smart contracts.
